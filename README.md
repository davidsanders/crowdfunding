## Note for Unity theme users ##

If you received this plugin as part of your purchase of the Unity WordPress Theme from ThemeForest, you may have seen a message that the plugin would be supported by *Studio 164a* for the users of Unity. I am sorry to say that this is false; the creators of Unity Theme wrote this without ever talking to us about it. 

### For a bit of background: ###

This plugin was originally developed by Astoundify. We (Studio 164a) created and sold a theme called Franklin, which was based on this plugin. After the plugin was sold to another company and discontinued by that company, we maintained support for customers of our theme, Franklin. We never supported the plugin for other theme users. 

In August 2015, we stopped selling our theme Franklin. We maintained support for pre-existing customers until March 2016, but now no longer support or develop Franklin or this plugin. However, it is an open-source plugin and anyone is more than welcome to fork it and continue development (hint, hint, opal_wp). 

Fast-forward to late March and we have discovered that opal_wp, the creators of Unity theme, changed the code of this plugin to say that Studio 164a will support customers of the Unity theme. This is not true, never has been true, and should never have been promised by opal_wp.

### What should you do? ###

Write to opal_wp and ask if _they_ will support the plugin for their customers. If they will not support it, you are unfortunately using a solution that is not actively developed or supported by anyone, and you may want to consider switching.
